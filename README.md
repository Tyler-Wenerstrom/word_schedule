# word_schedule
A work day scheduler page to assist in scheduling current or future days. Input a task into a specific time block and save to local storage. You will be able to read said task when page is refreshed or you return to page later. There is a past, present, and future color time stamp integrated into the page, allowing user to easily know when a task is due or when to write a new one. 

## Challenges
My major challenge was getting the saved input to persist to page when refreshed.
